    1. Introduction
    <br>
    <br>
    scheme was introduced in 1998 for issue of Kisan Credit Cards to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that farmers may use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs. The scheme was further extended for the investment credit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non-farm activities in the year 2004.
    <br>
    <br>
    On 18 December, 2020[2],Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Revised Scheme to Kisan Credit Card[3] (KCC) which aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window to the farmers for their cultivation and other needs.

    <br>
    <!-- <br>
    The credit limit under the Kisan Credit Card may be fixed as under:
    <br> -->
    <br>
    All farmers other than marginal farmers[11]:
    <br>
    <br>
    Scale of finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical Committee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10 per cent of limit towards post-harvest/household/ consumption requirements + 20 per cent of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance and/or accident insurance including PAIS, health insurance & asset insurance.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    First year limit for crop cultivation purpose arrived at as above plus 10 per ent of the limit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year) and estimated term loan component for the tenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years. (Illustration I)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per proposed cropping pattern for the first year plus an additional 10 per cent of the limit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the succeeding four years. In case the cropping pattern adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be reworked. (Illustration I)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The term loan for investment is to be made towards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.
    <br>
    <br>
    The long term loan limit should be based on the proposed investment(s) during the five-year period and the bank's perception on the repaying capacity of the farmer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and is to be treated as the Kisan Credit Card limit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A flexible limit of ? 10,000 to ? 50,000 may be provided (as Flexi KCC) based on the land holding and crops grown including post-harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investment(s) like purchase of farm equipment(s), establishing mini dairy/backyard poultry as per assessment of the Branch Manager without relating it to the value of land. The composite KCC limit is to be fixed for a period of five years on this basis. (Illustration II)
